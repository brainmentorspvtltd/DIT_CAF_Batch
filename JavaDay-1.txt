Java

- WORA: Write Once Run Anywhere
- Platform Independent or Portable
- Platform = O/S + Hardware

Source Code(.c) ----> Compile ----> Machine Code (.obj)

- C is not a platform independent or portable

Source Code (.java) -----> Compile ----> Byte Code or Intermediate code(.class) ---> Interpreter (JRE)
---> Machine Code

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
- JVM - Java Virtual Machine
- Libraries

Byte Code: Byte code is not a source code and not a machine code.

JRE: JRE read byte code and converted it into machine code.
