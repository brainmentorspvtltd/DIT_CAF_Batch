Java

Finalize()

- Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

Abstract:

- Abstract Methods are methods can only be declared, not defined.
- Abstract class can have abstract methods
- You can't create objects of abstract class

Interface:

Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables , but the methods declared in interface are by default abstract

Why we need Interface?

- It is used to achieve total abstraction
- Java doesot support multiple inheritance in case of classes but by using interface it can achieve multiple Interface

Lambda Expression:

- It is used to define a interface abstract method in a shortform.


Static use 

Object Life Cycle

- Class is loaded, Static block is call
