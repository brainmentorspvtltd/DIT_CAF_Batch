Inheritnace: Parent Child Relationship

- IS A Inheritance

this: It is used to store current object's address/reference
Super: It is used to call the parent's Contructors (in inheritnace only)

- HAS A Inheritance

by using extends keyword

Benefit:
- Code Reuseability

Overriding

- When parent feature is outdated so we override the parent feature in a child class.
- Override hide the parent feature.
- Must be inheritance
- Method Signature must be same
e.g:
void roi(), same child has same void roi()

Final Keyword:

- If a variable is declared with the final keyword it's value can't be changed once initialized.
- to prevent method overriding, can't be hide the parent feature using overriding
- to prevent inheritance, can't be subclassed/Inherit
