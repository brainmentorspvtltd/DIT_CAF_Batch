Java

Multilevel:

	A (P)


	B (C1)


	C (C2)

Why Multiple Inheritance is not supported in java?

- Remove ambiguity
- To provide clean code

Task - 1:

Parent Class: we have only one data member
Child Class: we have only one data member

Note: in both class data members name are same

Initialize the data members in Child class

Typecasting:

Upcasting: child class object is typecasting in parent class object
downcasting: parent class object is typecasting in child class object (explicitly)

Task -2 :

Multilevel Inheritance

- Shape--> Rectangle---> ColorRectangle


Heirarchical Inheritance

	  A (P)

    B(C1)	C (C1)
