Creating first program in java

- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either aplhabet or special symbol(_, $)


- Java code Compile: javac filename.java
- Java code Run/Execute: java Bytecode/Classname

main method:

- main is an entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code, but it cannot execute the code or interpret the code

4 types of scopes in java

public: global, which is accessible for all, from anywhere
private: accessible within the class only
protected: can be accessible outside the package by using inheritance and can also be accessible inside the package
default: It is not a resereved keyword, if your will not specify any scope then it is default.
The scope can be accessed by any class but within same package.

why main is public?

- JRE uses main
- java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load your class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from your directory
- And outside the package things can access

why main is static?

- Static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded.

why main is void?

- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

Main arguments - String[] args

- main has command line arguments
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of string

What is String?

- String is a collection of characters
- String internally is a char[]
- String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter


What is System.out.println("DIT")?

- println(): print in new line, println comes from out object
- out: out is a predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System: System is a predefined class used for input, output, and error
e.g: System.in, System.out, System.err

println vs print

println: print in new line
print: here cursor remains at the end of the text

can we overload main()?

- yes, we can overload main
- when we execute the class, JVM starts execution with public static void main(String[] args)
        

Define variable, Variable Declaration, local variable initialize must

- java doesn't have any garbage value
- it throws error
- local variable must be initialized before use, otherwise compilation fails
