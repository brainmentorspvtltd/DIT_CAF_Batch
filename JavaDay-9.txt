What is Package?

- Package is a folder behind the scene
- Package is a collection of classes, interfaces...
- We divide a big project into small2 packages
- So we can group similar nature code in same kind of package

scope: public

- It can access the class/constructor/function/variable outside the package
- Note: public class doesn't mean members are public
- If class is public so it must match with filename
- If one single file there is only one public class
- One single file has one public and n non-public classes

In development:

OOAD: Object Oriented Analysis and Design

SOLID Principle

- D: DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- S: SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

- One class One file
- If your class is public so class name must be same as file name
- so in one file we can have n non-public classes
- if one file (X.java) has 3 classes e.g:

class X{} class Y{} class Z{}
After Compile them it will create 3 byte codes
X.class, Y.class , Z.class
