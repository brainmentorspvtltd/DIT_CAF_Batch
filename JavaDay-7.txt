Java

2 major types of programming

- Procedural: Functions - Divide a problem into functions
- OOPS: wrap all the variables and functions/methods into a single unit

Why OOPS?

In C programming

class A
{
int x, y;

add()
{}

sub()
{}

div()
{}

mul()
{}
}

class B
{
sin()
{
  double x;
}
}


is Java has global variable?

- No, because in java every program start with class and class doesn't have global variable.

What is OOPS?

- Divide a big problem into classes

OOPS Features:

1. Class and Object

Object: Real World Entity or Physical Entity

e.g: car, projector, fan, a/c
e.g: amit, ram, shyam, rahul, ......

Class - Logical Entity - Collection of Similar objects

Blueprint, Category

- Collection of Features/Characteristics

e.g: class Human(Features Brain, Height, Weight)
object: ram brain sharp, 6 feet height


Student Example:

OOAD: Object Oriented Analysis and Design
- SOLID Principle

D: DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

Problem 1: Duplicacy in Code

Solution: Copy Paste alternate create a method and call it.

Problem 2: Security of the Code

Solution: Data Security

Encapsulation:

Wrap methods and member variables into a single unit and that unit is called class.

Data Hiding - Good Encapsulation

Data Hiding: make member variables private 
Good/Secure Encapsulation: Data Hiding + Encapsulation
