Q1. Need to intialize the member variable when object is construct.
- We need constructor for this
- Constructor is call when you create an object
- So constructor will initialize the member variable
- constructor name is same as class name
- constructor never return anything
- It is called only once
- One class can have multiple constructors, so this thing is called constructor overloading

When we need multiple constructor calls in a single call.
