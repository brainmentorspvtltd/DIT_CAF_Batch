String Handling

What is String?

- String internally char[]
e.g: String name = "Ram";
char name[] = {'R', 'a', 'm'};

- String is a predefine class in java
- It is also treat like a Data type
- String is a final class, so you can't inherit

String objects are created in two ways:

1. String Literal Style
e.g: String name = "Ram";

2. String Object Style
e.g: String name = new String("Ram");

- String use String Pool
- String objects are immutable
String doesn't change existing or original objects, ut can create new memory or object all the time.

Sol: StringBuffer is a mutuable class that means it doesn't create new objects or memory


- String is a predefine class in java, So it has lot of predefine functions inside the class

e.g: uppercase, lowercase, indexOf, equals, length
